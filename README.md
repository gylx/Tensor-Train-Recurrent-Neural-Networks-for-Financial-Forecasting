# Tensor Train Recurrent Neural Networks for Financial Forecasting

This repository contains the code for the my final year project at Imperial College London. Specifically, it explores the application of tensor-train decomposition for compression and regularization of neural networks in financial markets. 

There are 3 jupyter notebooks in this repository: 
1) "Raw Data Formatting.ipynb" is used to format the raw data to eliminate any inconsistencies in formatting (unfortunately, I cannot share the data used for this project, so adapt the models the way you need). 
2) "Features Generation 4.ipynb" produces features needed for the machine learning model. 
3) "FYP_Financial_Application_(Final).ipynb" runs the experiment with the given data. It is advised to run this notebook on google colaboratory.
